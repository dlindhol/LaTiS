LaTiS
=====

LaTiS is a unified scientific data model implementation and modular framework for data access, processing, and output 
with an OPeNDAP (DAP2) compliant service interface.

The code here currently has lots of rough edges but is evolving rapidly and has an increasing number of automated tests. 
It is being used in production server environments where we have control of the client (e.g. web pages making json requests).
I would not consider the LaTiS code to be truly "production ready" and exposed to the general user until
more error handling and tests come along. But if your data users prefer convenience over potentially cryptic error messages, go for it.
