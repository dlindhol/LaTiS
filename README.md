# LaTiS

LaTiS is a
[data model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model),
[domain specific language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language), and
[web service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service)
interface for reading, manipulating,
and writing scientific data.

The name "LaTiS" is a
[nacronym](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nacronym)
that formerly described the "LASP Time Series Server". It has also
been known as "TSS" and is the core component of the NASA Heliophysics funded Time Series Data Server
(TSDS) now hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/tsds/TSDS1).
The TSDS code base is also currently supporting data access for our
[LISIRD web site](http://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/).

The second generation LaTiS is being developed in
[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
and is currently managed in a
[git](http://git-scm.com/) repository
on our local [Stash server](http://stash.lasp.colorado.edu/projects/WEBAPPS/repos/latis-server-project-template/browse)
There are also a number of LaTiS based projects (e.g. MAVEN key parameters, MMS SITL, WebTCAD) being
developed that are managed on Stash as well.
