   * TODO: how could we do this in the context of resampling
   * Discrete telemetry should be filled with previous value: FloorResampling
   *   hard to implement as a fill value
   * Other data would generally use NoResampling and use a static fill value.
   * 
   * iterator of samples from each ds
   * peek at each
   * take min and resample other to that point
   * could add "same" logic but resample would just work
   * can we maintain previous value?
   *   not with a PeekIterator
   * what about resampling that uses more samples
   * seems like we need to support a running window for even 2 points
   * 
   * consider visad's approach: Set.indexOf(value)
   * but we are moving away from separate domain and range sets
   * 
   * SampledFunction has a Resampling strategy (akin to Ordering?)
   * Resampling trait/mixin
   *   iterate over samples with "sliding"
   *   
   * Instead of using peek, iterate over samples of 2 functions (a,b)
   * with sliding = 2 (1,2)
   * assume no extrapolation
   * 
   * a1 * * b1
   * a2 * 
   *      * b2
