TODO: id vs name, attribute vs metadata
is name an intrinsic thing? not just metadata?
value of id when parsing tsml?
  only used to get list of var names
  already a bit dicey, typically assumes only and all scalars have id
  need to consider named tuples, functions. later
refs to other elements
  don't want the ref defn to be in the model?
  id could be used for those
  name for all scalars
  should ref be a diff dataset with aggregation?
    no, undue complication
put name in scalar element as attribute? as opposed to metadata
  easier to parse tsml? no, just look for @name in metadata elements
  less of a burden on tsml author? wouldn't have to have metadata



need to keep source names, e.g. for constructing sql
  tsml should describe source
  alias att or metadata?
    user needs to see it so metadata
  rename PI
